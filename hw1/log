ESTIMATE of time to complete assignment: 8 hours

Date  Time   Spent Work completed
----  -----  ----  --------------
1/17  13:15  2:15  Read assignment, sketched outline, wrote rough code,
                   debugged compile time errors, but not logical bugs
1/19  17:15  3:00  Rewrote majority of code because I realized I misunderstood
                   part of the assignment; program mostly works now
1/20  15:00  1:30  Fixed several bugs (including how it handles quotes), but
                   just realized there is a major problem with the way my
                   program runs.  Realized I will have to make a big change
                   to handle the "look ahead"
1/21  11:00  1:30  Changed the way that my code handles the look ahead, now
                   uses ungetchar().  Code now passes all public tests

The biggest problem I had with this assignment is with the logic.  There is a
lot of logic (condition checking) in the while loop, and I had trouble thinking
of the order to put them in, and it was hard thinking of how to implement the
conditions.

I also had problems with thinking of how to implement the look ahead at the
next character.  At first, I just had the program getchar() the next character
(when necessary, for example, when looking for the beginning of a comment),
and compare it to what I'm expecting.  I didn't consider the case of what
happens if the next char is not what I'm expecting.

When I realized my mistake, I just had the program print the next character.
But then I realized that if the next char is something important, such as a
line splice, then that never gets tested, since we skipped testing the next
char with all the conditions.  So then I realized I had to use ungetchar().
